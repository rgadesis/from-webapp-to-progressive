#My first Progressive Web App

This project will guide you step by step during the development of an Angular 2 
web application. We will also include the changes needed in order to make our web 
application progressive.

##Note
This project is a work in progress.
Some tools and dependencies are now in pre-release state.

#Prerequisites
We will need to have Node, npm and Typings installed:
- Node >4 is needed. Node v6.2.2 was used during the development of this demo.
- npm v3.10.3 was used during the development of this demo.
- Typings >1 is needed. Typings 1.3.1 was used during the development of this demo.

#Installation
We are going to use [angular-cli](https://cli.angular.io/) to help us through the 
development. It will provide preconfigured automatic tasks and very usefull scaffolding
commands that will enhance our speed.

    npm install -g angular-cli

#Usage
    ng --help

#Next step
In the next step we are going to create a new Angular 2 project following the best 
practices suggested by the Angular team.
