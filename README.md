#Previously
In the previous step we installed material2 and configured our project so angular-cli and SystemJS know abuot them.
We alse check if material2 components were available in our project by importing `MdButton` and using it in our main component.

#Layout
FIrst of all we are going to create the main layout of our Web App. It is not going to be nothing fancy, just a toolbar and a spinner.
